# Patch-based_3D_U-Net
Divide a 3D volume into several patches. It trains the individual patches then predicts the label. 
The labels for the overlapping region of patches are determined by calculating the average probability map.

# Instruction
# Training
To train the model, set the training data directory in training.py and run the file. The weights of the model will be save to the models/ folder

# Testing
Measures a dice scores between the prediction and ground truth.
Run test.py
